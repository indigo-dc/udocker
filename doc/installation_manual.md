# udocker INSTALLATION MANUAL
In most circumstances the end user can download and execute the tool without
system administrator intervention. udocker itself is written in Python, but 
also uses external statically compiled binaries to provide a chroot like
environment where containers are executed. These tools do not require any
privileges.
  
## 1. DEPENDENCIES

Python dependencies are described in the file requirements.txt

udocker requires either pycurl or the curl executable command,
to download both the binaries and/or pull containers from repositories.

## 2. USER INSTALLATION

The official release of udocker is available from the INDIGO-DataCloud
repository at `http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu/` where is made available
as a tarball to be deployed by the end user. Allways check for the latest
official version released by INDIGO-DataCloud.

Install of udocker 1.0.1, 1.0.3 or higher released by INDIGO-DataCloud:

```
  curl http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu/repository/indigo/2/centos7/x86_64/tgz/udocker-1.0.3.tar.gz > udocker-tarball.tgz
  export UDOCKER_TARBALL=$(pwd)/udocker-tarball.tgz
  tar xzvf $UDOCKER_TARBALL udocker
  ./udocker version
  mv ./udocker $HOME   # move the executable to your preferred location for binaries
```

Install of the old udocker 1.0.0 released by INDIGO-DataCloud:

```
  cd $HOME
  wget -O- http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu/repository/indigo/1/centos7/x86_64/tgz/udocker-v1.0.0.tar.gz | tar xzvf -
  ./udocker.py
```

If using the setup.py provided in the releases install with:

```
  mkdir /tmp/somedir
  cd /tmp/somedir
  curl http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu/repository/indigo/2/centos7/x86_64/tgz/udocker-v1.X.X.tar.gz | tar xzvf -
  python setup.py install --home /home/USER/bin
```

Optionally just download and execute the udocker python script from the source and the
installation will be performed automatically. The installation from source code is not
officially supported by INDIGO-DataCloud.

For the master branch:

```
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigo-dc/udocker/master/udocker > udocker
  chmod u+rx ./udocker
  ./udocker version
```

For the development branch:

```
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigo-dc/udocker/devel/udocker > udocker
  chmod u+rx ./udocker
  ./udocker version
```

## 3. SYSTEM INSTALLATION WITH RPMs and DEBs

RPMs for CentOS are provided at http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu

Beware that these packages are intended to be used solely in the corresponding hosting
operating systems as they are dynamically compiled against the host libraries.  If the
same udocker is to be used across multiple operating systems then use the installation
method described above in section 2. The tarball package is statically compiled and
will work across different hosting operating systems.

```
  rpm -i udocker-1.0.3-1.noarch.rpm 
  rpm -i udocker-preng-1.0.3-1.x86_64.rpm
```

DEBs for Ubuntu are provided at http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu

```
  dpkg -i udocker_1.0.3-1_all.deb
  dpkg -i udocker-preng_1.0.3-1_amd64.deb
```

## 4. SYSTEM INSTALLATION WITH ANSIBLE AND PYTHON

For system administrators wishing to provider udocker and its dependencies. 
An ansible playbook is provided in the file ansible_install.yaml:

```
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigo-dc/udocker/master/ansible_install.yaml > ansible_install.yaml

  ansible-playbook ansible_install.yaml
```

Under debian based systems ansible can be installed with:

```
  apt install ansible
```

Under RH based systems ansible can be installed with:

```
  yum install epel-release 
  yum install ansible
```

Optionally installation can be performed directly with pip:

```
  pip install git+https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker
```

## 5. SOURCE CODE

To get the latest udocker script from the github development branch without
cloning the entire repository.
```
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigo-dc/udocker/devel/udocker.py
```

To get the udocker source code repository from the github master branch, clone the 
repository, or use a web browser to access github at `https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker`.

```
  git clone https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker
```

To get the udocker source code repository from the development branch.

```
  git clone -b devel https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker
```


## 6. BUILD

A distribution tarball can be built using the script build_tarball.sh in
the utils directory. The script fetches the code necessary to build the
binary executables such as proot and compiles them statically. The following
example builds the tarball from the master repository.

```
  git clone https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker
  cd udocker/utils
  sh build_tarball.sh
```
 
## 7. DIRECTORIES

The binary executables and containers are usually kept in the user home directory
under $HOME/.udocker this directory will contain:

 * Additional tools and modules for udocker such as proot.
 * Data from pulled container images (layers and metadata).
 * Directory trees for the containers extracted from the layers.
 

## 8. ENVIRONMENT

The location of the udocker directory can be changed via environment variables.

 * UDOCKER_DIR : change the root directory of udocker usually $HOME/.udocker
 * UDOCKER_BIN : change the location of udocker related executables
 * UDOCKER_LIB : change the location of udocker related libraries
 * UDOCKER_CONTAINERS : change the location of container directory trees (not images)

The docker index and registry and be overrided via environment variables.

 * UDOCKER_INDEX : https://...
 * UDOCKER_REGISTRY : https://...
 

## 9. CONFIGURATION

udocker loads the following configuration files:

 * /etc/udocker.conf
 * $UDOCKER_DIR/udocker.conf
 * $HOME/.udocker/udocker.conf (if different from the above)

The configuration files allow modification of the udocker Config class attributes.
Example of the udocker.conf syntax:

```
  dockerio_registry_url = "https://myregistry.mydomain:5000"
  http_insecure = True
  verbose_level = 5
```
